      <h2>Carefree History</h2>
      <p>The Town of Carefree was the vision of KT Palmer and Tom Darlington in the early 1950's. Two men who carried out many of their joint ventures on a simple handshake created the Carefree Development Corporation which spawned the name of the town. People across America were starting to read about the whimsical street names and extreme care in protecting and preserving the pristine indigenous desert growth and was touted as being well ahead of the nation in land planning.</p>
      <p>Carefree experienced tremendous growth from 1959 to 1984, prior to incorporation. Carefree featured Arizona's first fly-in residences at the Sky Ranch Airport, who would travel from all over the country to experience the Sonoran Desert and buy land from the Carefree Development Corporation. Projects were springing up like the Spanish Village at the center of town to the Carefree Inn and the well known International Restaurant.</p>
      <p>The catchy street names along with marketing of the Town expanded to celebrities who saw this oasis as a playground including, Bob Hope, Barry Goldwater, Paul Harvey, Hugh Downs and Orson Welles. The resident read like a corporate Who's Who of America, a place where wealthy corporate executives could bring their families to spend quiet time and get away for swimming, golf, and horseback riding.</p>
